## Noteworthy Side Projects

**TitanOSX** - `https://github.com/TitanOSX/titan`  
TitanOSX was inspired by the Etsy MIDAS project, but after an almost complete refactoring, I added client transparency. By this, there is a client utility which can be accessed to manage the tool, included monitors, and self-destructing reports. I also created a RESTful interface for online, remote reporting.

**Masterbaker** - `https://github.com/mikemackintosh/masterbaker`  
Masterbaker was ported from Soloist, one of the simplest ways to manage workstations using Chef. The large improvement of Masterbaker allows organizations to manage both company-wide and user-level run lists independently to give better control over configurations.

**ruby-ipaddress** `https://github.com/bluemonk/ipaddress`    
I've submitted several pull-requests which have been pulled into master which add support for unsigned 32-bit IP address parsing and `IPv4#to_h` methods. After showing interest in this project, I became a co-maintainer of it to help it grow.
